After a few years of thinking about it, I finally started to put my website together. The writing blog section is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), so I can use Markdown to author my posts. A helpful resource in getting this site together can be found [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
