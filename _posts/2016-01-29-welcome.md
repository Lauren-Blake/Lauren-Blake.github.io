After a few years of thinking about it, I finally started to put my website together. The true catalyst for this website was that I wanted a place to compile and share writing resources while I was writing my second paper of graduate school and (hopefully) beyond. After the process of writing my first [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/09/135442) was so stressful, I told myself that I would be better the second time. I spent a lot of time reflecting about what I could do better the second time around and have chosen to document it. It is my goal that this documentation could be turned into resources for other STEM PhD students that were writing papers, fellowships, etc. Once the resources are complete, they will be released on this website. 

First, a few housekeeping things, as well as thank yous. Thanks to [Arjun Biddanda](https://aabiddanda.github.io/), who originally introduced me to GitHub pages and Jekyll. In fact, the writing section of this site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). While I had trouble reading a lot of the Jekyll's starting guide, I scoured the internet and came across this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/) and can be found [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). This tutorial was incredibly clear and saved me many hours of frustration. Therefore, I conclude this post with a major thank you to Jonathan!
