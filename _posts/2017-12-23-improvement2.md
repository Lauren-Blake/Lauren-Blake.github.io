As part of my last [post](http://lauren-blake.github.io/2017/12/21/improvement1.html), I wrote the 5 headers of my paper. For the next step, I wrote out the figures, tables, topics/material that would go in the supplement, supplementary figures, and supplementary tables. Initially, it was really overwhelming to see everything that needed to happen for the paper (in addition to the actual writing). But after I had come to terms with that list, I realized this process helped me to organize what would go in each section of the paper (so I guess all the panic was worth it?).
