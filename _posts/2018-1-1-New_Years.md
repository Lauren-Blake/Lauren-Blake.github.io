2017 was a big step forward for my writing. After making it my weekly goal for about 5 months, by the end of September I was finally writing for 30 minutes each day, Monday through Friday. Short seminars from the [National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity (NCFDD)](https://www.facultydiversity.org) were critical to push myself to get in the habit of 30 minutes every day. If your university offers free access to the NCFDD (like the University of Chicago does), I HIGHLY recommend checking it out!

Ever go home after work and wonder, "what did I do all day?". Well, I found myself doing that a bunch in the later part of the year, particularly during the month of November. Consequently, for my research-related New Year's Resolution for this year, I am going to track my time spent each day on anything related to my research. This tracking will (a) allow me to see how I am spending my time and (b) hold myself accountable each day.  

For additional motivation, I am giving you access. Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jXl2_-toVVKzgJ6sB7fuBkDHSJtIWKFBEyieRa1mof8/edit?usp=sharing) to see my progress. I am going to update it before I go home each day (at least), as well as what I do on the weekends.
